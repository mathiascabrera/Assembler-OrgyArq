<h2>Flowchart - Fourth example</h2>
<h4>Create a list of 12 integers (even and odd), of size 1 Byte, stored at address $90.<br>Every time an odd value is found, 1 must be added to it and overwritten in the list.<br>At the end of the program, all values ​​in the list must be even.<br>At address $80 the number of elements in the list is indicated (LENGTH = 12).<br>Save the total of odd numbers at address $81.</h4>
